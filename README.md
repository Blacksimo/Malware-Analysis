# Malware-Analysis

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a valuable tool to recognize and classify different kind of Malware Application, running on AndroidOS, through the use of several Machine Learning Classifiers.

In order to train the above-mentioned classifiers, we're taking advantage of the [Drebin Dataset](https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/~danarp/drebin/index.html), which provide us 5,560 malevolent files from 179 different malware families, collected in the period of August 2010 to October 2012.

From those applications we are extracting features through the manifest.xml file and the disassembled code.

## A Classification Problem
Classification belongs to the category of supervised learning where the targets (or labels or categories) are also provided with the input data and it is, in fact, the process of predicting the class of given data points. Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a target function (f) from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y).

The input variable chosen for this project is a list of vectors, each of which specify, for each malware, the features of the application itself, previously retrieved from a dictionary of all the features.

As expected, the output variable is a list containing the category of each malware.

## Final Considerations

### Choosen Features and Classifiers
A wide range of attempts has been made in order to find the categories that performs better with this classification problem.
Almost all the possibile combinations between the features have been tried, highlighting that, category such as "feature" or "provider", which generates alone a dictionary containing less than 50 words, do not increase the accuracy when combined with others category, therefore they'have been deleted from the list.

On the other side, there are categories such as "permission" or "api_call" that perform amazing results all alone (an average of 90% of accuracy with the three classifiers). It has been easy to maximize the perfomance starting from those categories.

In all of the attempts, Random Forest and SVM performed a lot better than Naive Bayes, so the final goal of the task had been maximizing the perfomance of that specific classifiers. That combination has been found in the categories "permission", "service_receiver" and "activity".

### From the Graph

The graphs showed above highlight streghts and weaknesses of each classifier, which is an extension of what it has been already told. 

Besides the fact that Naive Bayes performs worse than the other two in most of the cases, also the time spent to train the classifier needs to be considered. It's clear that the Support Vector Machine is the slowest one and that's because its fit time complexity is more than quadratic with the number of samples, which makes it hard to scale to huge dataset (in this case, samples number equal to the number of malware files).

From the results of this project it's cristal clear that, among the studied three, the classifier that best fit this classification problem is the Random Forest.
